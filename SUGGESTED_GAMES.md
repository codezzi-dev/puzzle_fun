# Suggested Simple Games for Puzzle Challenge

Based on the existing tech stack (Canvas, Drag & Drop, TTS), here are the suggested simple game ideas for preschoolers:

## 1. 🎈 Balloon Pop (Action/Identification)
- **Goal**: Pop balloons that float up the screen.
- **Simple Mode**: Pop any balloon for fun.
- **Learning Mode**: "Pop only the **RED** balloons" or "Pop balloon **Number 5**".
- **UX**: Satisfying "pop" sound effects and colorful confetti bursts.

## 2. 👥 Shadow Match (Visualization)
- **Goal**: Drag a colored object (animal, toy, or fruit) to its matching black silhouette (shadow).
- **Educational Value**: Enhances visual discrimination and shape recognition.
- **Tech**: Leverages the `Draggable` and `DragTarget` logic already used in **Robot Builder**.

## 3. 🃏 Memory Flip (Logic/Memory)
- **Goal**: A grid of cards (4x4 or 3x2). Tap to flip and find matching pairs of colors or shapes.
- **UI**: Uses smooth 3D flip animations (already possible with `Transform`).
- **Educational Value**: Focus and short-term memory improvement.

## 4. 🍎 Size Sorter (Ordering)
- **Goal**: Three items of different sizes (e.g., Small, Medium, Large bears) need to be placed in the correct boxes.
- **Educational Value**: Basic concept of scale and comparison.
- **UX**: "Snap-to-box" animation with TTS feedback ("That's the BIG bear!").

## 5. 🐝 Trace the Path (Motor Skills)
- **Goal**: Help an animal get to its food by tracing a dashed line with a finger.
- **Tech**: Uses a simplified version of the `LinePainter` found in **Color Match**.
- **Educational Value**: Pre-writing skills and hand-eye coordination.

## 6. 🔊 Sound Match (Auditory)
- **Goal**: Listen to a sound (e.g., Cow "Moo") and tap the correct animal from 3 options.
- **Educational Value**: Auditory processing and animal recognition.
